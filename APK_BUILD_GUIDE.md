I've successfully set up Capacitor for Android APK generation:

**✅ Installed Dependencies:**
- @capacitor/cli

- @capacitor/android

**✅ Project Configuration:**

## 🚧 Current Status

The React build is taking longer than expected due to the large number of UI components and dependencies. However, the Android project structure is ready.

## 📱 Next Steps to Generate APK

### Option 1: Quick APK Generation (Current Setup)
```bash
# Copy current files to Android project
npx cap copy

# Open Android Studio project  
npx cap open android

# In Android Studio:
# 1. Click "Build" → "Generate Signed Bundle/APK"
# 2. Choose "APK" 
# 3. Select "release" build variant
# 4. Click "Build"
```

### Option 2: Complete Build (Recommended)
```bash
# Wait for full React build to complete
npm run build

# Copy complete build to Android
npx cap copy

# Sync native dependencies
npx cap sync

# Open in Android Studio
npx cap open android
```

## 🛠️ Android Studio Requirements

To build the APK, you need:
- **Android Studio** installed
